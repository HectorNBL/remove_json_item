## Start 
1. In your terminal git clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/HectorNBL/remove_json_item.git
```
2. Open your IDE of choice. I used VScode and open the "remove_json_items" folder. 

3. Open the remove_items_json.py file.

4. Write the name for each item you want to delete in the array at the top:

```obj_to_del = ["name", "symbol"]``` #Here I am deleting the items: name and symbol

5. Run the program. In VsCode there is a "Run Python File" at the top left. Check your files.
